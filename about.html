<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I was born and raised here on Oahu, Hawaii. I have 3 siblings, recently my older sister moved out for college so now I am the older sister. I love volleyball, I started when I was 6 and joined club when I was 10. I'm a setter and libero and I recently tried out for TeamUSA Youth National Volleyball Team. I have big hopes and dreams, I want to be an Aerospace Engineer and my dream school to go to is M.I.T.</p>
