<h3>About Me</h3>
<p> sABOUT ME: 
some basic info about me: I'm a sophomore at James Campbell Highschool. I have four siblings and recently my older sister went away for college so I have taken on the full responsibility as the older sibling, pretty stressful not going to lie! I was born and raised her on O'ahu,Hawaii and I speak fluent pidgin... LOL. When i'm at school I tend to sound very proper but when i'm around my friends and family my TITA comes out, it really shocks people when they first hear me and it's pretty great :)  Like any EWABEACH BANGAH, i am a very loud and enthusiastic person who loves to meet new people and stay connected with my peers. Many people take me for someone who is shy but i am the complete opposite when I want to talk to someone. I love volleyball, I started when I was 6 and joined club when I was 10. I'm a setter and libero and I recently tried out for TeamUSA Youth National Volleyball Team. I have no idea how to code and if this is going to turn out good but i'm trying, so if this goes good , SHOUT OUT to the indian guy on youtube LOL.

Hobbies & Fun Facts: Some of my hobbies include student council, volleyball, National Honor Society, shopping, spending time with my siblings, going to the beach, and traveling. I've been Washington, Idaho, California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Ohio, New York, Boston, and New Hampshire. People call me an old soul because i love old school music but it really is the best hits compared to today's music. I love strawberries and watermelons. i don't eat steak,pork, or ribs, UNLESS it's lau lau or kalua pig because those are the ono grindz i cannot resist. My favorite place to eat out is Genki Sushi even though i'm allergic to shellfish, i'm really the cheapest person to take with you hehe:)</p>
